# Satelite Catalogo Backend

This Go service provides a REST API for managing products, users and solicitudes. It uses MongoDB as a storage backend and Gin as the HTTP framework.

## Development

1. Install Go 1.24 or newer.
2. Copy `.env` files and set required environment variables.
3. Run `go run main.go` to start the API on port `8080`.
4. API documentation is available at `/swagger/index.html` once the server is running.
